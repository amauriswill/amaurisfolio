    Hey, welcome to my digital warehouse. I am
    <strong>Amauris Willmore</strong> , a product designer based out of
    <strong>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</strong> Most recently, I
    worked with Obvious as a product designer on various client and internal
    projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    My love for design started during my last years of college, designing
    posters, music covers and collaterals for some emerging artist on my
    city.
    <br />
    <br />
    Gradually, my interest shifted
    <strong>from graphic design to digital product design.</strong> After
    finishing my <strong>studies on Visual Arts</strong>, I worked as a
    product designer with various startups and big companies.
    <br />
    <br />
    These days, I focus mainly on
    <strong
      >designing systems, interaction design, prototyping, and coding my
      designs.</strong
    >
    I enjoy solving challenging problems and crafting delightful
    experiences.
    <br />
    <br />
    I like connecting with new people. I lose track of time when playing
    guitar/piano 🎸🎹, reading a great book 📖, cooking 👨‍🍳, walking 🚶🏾, or
    <strong>watching</strong> a great <strong>serie or a movie.</strong>
